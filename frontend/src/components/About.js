            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Josh and I am the developer of rKD. I enjoy playing board games and video games and decided it would be really 
                cool to have a site where users would be able to find all sorts of board games in one place and be able to play all
                these games in one place. Some things I enjoy besides games are music, teaching, and advances in biochemical research.
